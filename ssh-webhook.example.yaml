# List of SSH servers to connect to.
ssh:
  # SSH servers to connect to
  servers:
    - name: "server1" # SSH name to identify the server in the webhook configuration
      host: "remote.server.com" # SSH host (include the port if not 22)
      user: "root" # SSH user
      password: "password" # SSH password
      # SSH private key. If provided, the password will be ignored.
      # The key must be in PEM format.
      # If the key is encrypted, the passphrase must be provided.
      path_to_key: "/path/to/key.pem"
      passphrase: "passphrase"
      # Keep the SSH connection alive
      # This is useful if webhook is used to execute commands frequently.
      # If the connection is not kept alive, response time will be slow since,
      # the SSH connection will be established every time.
      keep_alive: true # default: true
      # Retry to connect to the SSH server if the connection failed.
      retry: true # default: true
      # The number of times to retry to connect to the SSH server if the connection failed.
      # 0 means infinite
      retry_count: 0 # default: 0
      # The number of seconds to wait before retrying to connect to the SSH server if the connection failed.
      retry_interval: 15 # default: 15
      # The number of seconds to wait for the SSH server to respond.
      timeout: 30 # default: 30
      # Known hosts is a list of known hosts to be used to verify the SSH server.
      # If ignore_known_hosts is true, the known hosts will not be checked.
      # It is not recommended to ignore the known hosts. This is only useful for testing.
      # Follow the tutorial to add the SSH server to the known hosts.
      ignore_known_hosts: true # default: false
# List of webhooks to be used to execute commands on the SSH servers
webhooks:
  # Server path to be used in the webhook url (e.g https://ssh.example.com/server1)
  - path: "server1"
    # SSH server name for command to be executed on
    ssh_name: "server1"
    # List of commands allowed to be executed using this server.
    # If both "blacklist" and "whitelist" not provided, all commands will be allowed.
    # If the command, starts with one of the following entries it will be allowed.
    cmd_whitelist:
      - "ls"
    # List of commands not allowed to be executed using this server.
    # If whitelist is provided, blacklist will be ignored.
    # If the command, starts with one of the following entries it will be denied.
    cmd_blacklist:
      - "rm"
    # Webhook authentication for this server
    auth:
      # List of allowed ip addresses.
      # If both "whitelist" and "blacklist" not provided, all ip addresses will be allowed.
      ip_whitelist:
        - "192.168.1.9"
      # List of denied ip addresses.
      # If whitelist is provided, blacklist will be ignored.
      ip_blacklist:
        - "192.168.1.8"
      # The header to retrieve the ip address from. If not provided, the ip address will be retrieved from the request.
      # Remove this if the application is not behind a reverse proxy such as Nginx, Caddy, Apache, etc.
      # Make sure the application gets the correct ip address for rate limiting the unauthorized requests.
      ip_from_header: "X-Forwarded-For"
      # The header information to authenticate the request.
      # If not provided no header authentication will be required.
      headers:
        # Some examples of headers that can be used for authentication
        "X-Auth-Token": "secret-token"
        "X-Auth-User": "username"
